I began drumming at a young age and have found it to be a powerful way to express myself and relieve stress. Drumming isn’t just about keeping tempo; it’s about creating a backbone for the music and energizing the entire band.\nThe physicality of drumming is matched by its mental benefits. It requires coordination, timing, and rhythm, which are skills that have helped me in many other areas of life. Whether I’m practicing alone or playing with a group, drumming gives me a sense of accomplishment and joy.\nI particularly enjoy playing in various styles, from rock and jazz to funk and blues. Each style offers unique challenges and opportunities for creativity.
