I began drumming at a young age and have found it to be a powerful way to express myself and relieve stress.

It requires coordination, timing, and rhythm, which are skills that have helped me in many other areas of life. Whether I’m practicing alone or playing with a group, drumming gives me a sense of accomplishment and joy.\nI particularly enjoy playing in various styles, from rock and jazz to funk and blues. Each style offers unique challenges and opportunities for creativity. Drumming has also allowed me to meet and collaborate with other musicians, expanding my social network and deepening my appreciation for music.\n\n\n\nDrums"
